# todo-list-top2
This project is part of TOP curriculum which aims to create a Todo List. 

In this project I aim to strengthen my skills in separating the application logic from the user interface
so when I need to make changes in either field, it wont drastically affect the other one.

Javascript
- creating todo-items as objects.
